			<p>What does cyber security mean and what is its importance today?
				EmailTweetLikeSharePin itWhatsApp
				If you have a company, you need to know more about cyber security and all its benefits. With the advancement in technology and its increasingly present use in our lives and in companies, the number of virtual attacks also grows.
			</p>

			<p>These attacks can compromise a company's entire system and finding alternatives to protect yourself and your data is becoming more and more important.
			</p>

			<h4>O que Ã© CyberSecurity?</h4>

			<p>Cyber security is nothing more than a set of techniques whose main objective is to prevent hacker attacks on business systems. These actions try to detect possible intrusions and still protect the system so that these attacks are more difficult.
			</p>

			<p>Security is against physical damage that can be caused to equipment, but also against damage to the company's internal networks. The data of the company, its employees and even customers are protected by cyber security.
			</p>

			<h4>Who should invest in cyber security?</h4>

			<p>It may sound strange, but most companies affected by cyberattacks are small and medium-sized businesses. This is because, in general, the systems of these companies are simpler and less secure.
			</p>

			<p>Of course, large companies suffer from attack attempts, but small companies have a much greater chance of success. And corporate data is not the only concern, customer data is also a target for hackers.
			</p>

			<p>Data security is directly related to a company's trust and credibility. Thus, a company that allows attacks not only spends on the problems caused by the attack, but also loses a significant part of its customer base.
			</p>

			<p>Therefore, all companies, whether large or small, public or private, should invest in cybersecurity. The best way to do this is to hire a professional or a company that specializes in this type of service.
